### How to use the app
- To create a node, hold `a` and click.
- To connect a node to another node, select a node, hold `c` and drag your cursor to a node that you want to connect this first node to. A line will automatically display as `c` is held and if you click one your cursor is over the other node, the connection will be formed.
- To pan across the screen, hold the middle button on your mouse and drag across.
- To rename a node, double click on the node you want to rename, and you will enter "naming mode". When in "naming mode", you can start typing any alphanumeric key (including capitals) and the name will start to display. To exit out of "naming mode" and go back to playing with the active objects, press either `escape`, `enter`, or click off of the node you are renaming.
- To select multiple nodes at once, you can either use the rectangular lasso tool or select them manually. To use the lasso tool, click off a node and dragging your mouse across the screen to create a rectangular area such that all nodes found inside of them after releasing the mouse will be in "selected mode" (yellow highlight around those nodes). To select them manually, click on all the nodes you want with the ⌘ ("command") key held down.
	- It is possible to drag multiple nodes at the same time. With multiple nodes in "selected mode", hold the ⌘, click any of the selected nodes, and move your mouse across the screen.
- To create a `cluster` out of a set of nodes, select the desired nodes (as explained above) and press the `g` key.
	- Current Limitation: You cannot rename `clusters`.
